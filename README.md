# EsLint Configuration Migration :  

# Explanation of Additions:

# Vue Plugin Rules:

vuePlugin.configs['vue3-essential'].rules: This imports the essential rules for Vue 3 applications, such as ensuring proper Vue syntax and preventing common mistakes. You can adjust this to use vue3-recommended or vue3-strongly-recommended based on your project needs.

# TypeScript Plugin Rules:
typescriptPlugin.configs.recommended.rules: This includes all the recommended rules from the TypeScript plugin, which enforce best practices for TypeScript code (such as typing, avoiding unsafe constructs, etc.).

# Prettier Integration:
'prettier/prettier': 'error': This rule ensures that Prettier formatting is enforced. If Prettier detects any formatting issues, they will be marked as errors, which can then be automatically fixed using eslint --fix.

# Custom Rules:
We keep the no-console and no-debugger rules dynamic based on the environment (development or production).
Additional TypeScript rules like @typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type and @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars are customized based on common practices.
